This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Deploy on AWS

You can change the package.json script's "build" command to have "next build && next export" (instead of just "next build") to additionally export the website to the "out" folder. You can upload these files to HCS' hcs-website-2022 S3 bucket. See [article](https://dev.to/hossamelmansy/hosting-static-next-js-website-on-aws-s3-32lm) for specific steps.
